        <p id="bottom-text">My opponent tries to break the center with moving a pawn to c5,however, I reply with c3, stabilizing the center with my pawn chain.</p>

        <p id="bottom-text">He increases pressure to my d4 pawn by moving a knight to c6, I defend back with knight to f3.

    </div>
    <div class="ChessCol">
        <img src="chess4.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">He moves their light-squared bishop to d7, in case if I pin the knight and the bishop can't really be used for anything else anyways in early game currently. I keep reinforcing the center by moving my dark-squared bishop to e3.</p>

        <p id="bottom-text">We exchanged pawns from c5 pawn takes d5 pawn, and c3 pawn recaptures d4 pawn. This opens the C file, which our rooks can use in the future.</p>

        <img src="chess6.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">He develops his queen to b6, threathening to take my b2 pawn as well as increasing pressure onto my d4 pawn. I respond to moving my queen d2, still protecting the d4 pawn as well as protecting my b2 pawn.</p>

        <p id="bottom-text">He prepares his rook into the C file, and so did I but it was considered an inaccuracy, according to the computer.</p>

    <div class="ChessCol">
        <img src="chess9.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">He develops his knight to e7, preparing to move it to f5 and increasing further pressure to the d4 pawn, but before that, I threathen to take his dark square bishop with my A pawn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ChessCol">
        <img src="chess10.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">He decides to take my knight, otherwise, if he moves his dark-squared bishop to the only safe square, which is a5, I can play pawn to d4, trapping his bishop. I decide to recapture the bishop with the rook.</p>

    <div class="ChessCol">
        <img src="chess11.png" alt="">

    <div class="ChessCol">
        <img src="chess13.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">I capture the knight with my light-squared bishop because it cannot support my pawn structure that is dark-squared and the bishop can at least remove an attacker.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ChessCol">
        <img src="chess14.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">He recaptures my bishop with his E pawn, causing him to have doubled pawn in the F file, and an isolated pawn on d5.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ChessCol">
        <img src="chess14.5.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">I castled my king and planning to move my rook to c1, having doubled rooks on the C file.</p>

        <img src="chess15.png" alt="">
        <p id="bottom-text">He strangely pushes his H pawn forward once to h6, so I resumed to my plan of having doubled rooks on the C file.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ChessCol">

    <div class="ChessCol">
